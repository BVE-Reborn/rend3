# rend3 Examples

The examples are separate crates, so to run an example run `cargo run <name>`.

If you want to demo running rend3, [`scene-viewer`](scene-viewer) is what you should use. It is a full fledged gltf viewer.

If you want to look at how the basics of the code works, look at either the [`cube`](cube) or [`cube-no-framework`](cube-no-framework) example.

| skinning            | Basic bone deformation of a loaded gltf model | ![](skinning/screenshot.png) |
| static-gltf         | Similar to cube, but geometry is pulled from a simple gltf file | ![](static-gltf/screenshot.png) |
| textured-quad       | Basic 2D rendering with an orthographic camera | ![](textured-quad/screenshot.png) |
