## v0.3.0

Released 2022-02-11

This is by far the largest release of rend3 since 0.1. I have done my best to document everything that has changed.

### Major Changes
- rend3-pbr got renamed to rend3-routine and will host all render routines, not just PBR related ones.

### Added
- rend3-egui: An integration with the immediate mode GUI [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) @MindSwipe
- rend3-textured-quad: Add example of simple 2D rendering.
- rend3: Allow duplicating objects overriding some of their properties. @setzer22
- rend3: Implement mesh skinning. @setzer22
- rend3: Added `CameraProjection::Raw`.
- rend3: The renderer now has a `handedness` value that determines the handedness of its coordinate system.
  This allows the renderer to deal with both DX-convention coordinate systems and OpenGL convention coordinate systems.
- rend3-gltf: Load gltf animation data @setzer22

### Changes
- rend3: Instead of passing a render routine to the render function, 
  you now add them to a rendergraph, then pass that rendergraph into the renderer.
  - rend3-routine:
    - The old `PbrRoutine` has been replaced with the more vercitile `BaseRenderGraph`.
    - This base rendergraph will put all the parts together through it's `add_to_graph` function.
    - Split the PbrRoutine into two parts `add_prepass_to_graph` and `add_forward_to_graph`.
    - Split out the skybox renderer into `SkyboxRoutine`.
    - Split out tonemapping into the `TonemappingRoutine`.
- rend3: Renamed the old `RendererMode` to `RendererProfile` and adjusted verbiage to refer to them as profiles.
  - "CpuPowered" => "CpuDriven".
  - "GpuPowered" => "GpuDriven".
- rend3: All meshes now require validation.
  - `MeshBuilder::new()` now takes a handedness of the mesh. If it doesn't match the handedness of the renderer, it flips the winding order.
  - `MeshBuilder::build()` now returns a `Result<Mesh, MeshValidationError>`. This validation can be unsafely omitted.
  - The implementation functions `Mesh::calculate_normals{,_for_buffers}` and `Mesh::calculate_tangents{,_for_buffers}` are now unsafe.
- rend3: Renamed `CameraProjection::Projection` to `CameraProjection::Perspective`.
- rend3: Allow requesting device features explicitly in `rend3::create_iad`. @setzer22
- rend3: Objects now take a `mesk_kind` allowind definition of static or animated meshes. @setzer22
- rend3-routine: All transparency now has backface culling enabled. Use `Mesh::double_side` or `MeshBuilder::with_double_side` to re-enable double sided transparency.
- rend3-gltf: Split return value of `load_gltf` into per-scene data and per-instance data. @setzer22
- rend3-gltf: The `nodes` vector is now flat instead of nested. Hierarchy is represented using indices. @setzer22

### Fixes
- rend3: Fixed objects becoming invalid after a vertex buffer resize occured.
- rend3: Get vertex/index counts from RangeAllocator. @jamen
- rend3: Fix compatibility comparison for RenderPassTargets. @setzer22

## v0.2.0

Released 2021-10-09

This release saw a signifigant amount of cpu side optimization.
In a 50k object scene, the render loop went from taking 16ms to taking 1.75ms, a 9x speedup

### Added
- rend3: Added an explicit dependency on wgpu-core and wgpu-hal to ensure bug-fixes are included.
- rend3-gltf: Add the ability to turn off image's default features.
- rend3-gltf: Add support for ktx2 and dds images.
- rend3-gltf: Expose implementation functions
- rend3-pbr-bake: Added crate for automatic light baking to a texture.

### Changed
- rend3: IMPORTANT: You now must call output.present() in order for things to show up on screen.
- rend3: `Material` is now a trait and render routines can specify their own material.
  - `rend3::types::Material` is now `rend3_pbr::material::PbrMaterial`
  - `Renderer::update_material` no longer takes a `MaterialChange`, it takes a completely new material.
- rend3: renderlists refactored to have a generic Input and Output.
  - `Renderer::renderer` passes through the Input and Output.
  - OutputFrame is now a user-side only utility.
- rend3: AddTexture* will now create/upload the texture before the call returns.
- rend3: ResourceHandle<T> now prints the actual reference count while debug printing.
- rend3: `CameraProjection` now deals with view matrix, instead of location/yaw/pitch @scoopr
- rend3: Update to glam 0.19 @scoopr
- rend3 & rend3-gltf: update to wgpu 0.11
- rend3-pbr: Input is of type `()` and Output is type `&TextureView`.
- rend3-gltf: Added labels to all the different data types.
- rend3-gltf: Errors now use a `SsoString` instead of a `String` for the URI.
- rend3-gltf: All implementation functions no longer write into a single `&mut LoadedGltfScene`, but return their results directly.

### Fixed
- rend3: No longer require pipeline rebuilds when bind group length updates.
- rend3-pbr: fix rendering of cutout objects in shadow passes.
- rend3-pbr: remove redundant material changes in cpu mode.

## v0.1.1

Released 2021-09-13

### Added
- rend3-pbr: `set_ambient_lighting` sets the ambient light value, making sure no lighting result is less than `ambient * color`.

### Fixed
- rend3: properly exported `ExtendedAdapterInfo`

## v0.1.0

Released 2021-09-11

### Added
- rend3: Materials now have a `Transparency` field that supports Opaque, Cutout, and Blend transparency modes.
- rend3: `AlbedoComponent::TextureVertexValue` to represent `texture * vertex * constant`
- rend3: Mipmaps can be generated automatically on the gpu without the user needing to upload them.
- rend3: `Renderer::add_texture_2d_from_texture` which allows you to make a new texture from a set another texture's mipmaps.
- rend3 & rend3-pbr: Use `wgpu-profiler` to generate GPU timings that show up as `RendererStatistics`.
- rend3 & rend3-pbr: Annotate most code with `profiling` spans.
- rend3 & rend3-pbr: Add a `distance` field that signifies how much space shadows should take up.
- rend3-pbr: All major rendering spans are labeled and show up in renderdoc
- rend3-pbr: Multisampling support
- rend3-pbr: Support for transparency as well as stable gpu-culling to preserve transparency sort order.

### Changed
- rend3: **SUBTLE** All handles are now refcounted.
  - Handles are now `!Copy`. Functions taking handles now accept a reference to a handle.
  - If you want to keep something alive, you need to keep the handle to it alive.
  - `Object`s will keep `Material`s/`Mesh`s alive.
  - `Material`s will keep `Texture`s alive.
  - All resources are removed the `render()` after they are deleted.
- rend3: Externalize all surfaces, adapters, devices, etc.
  - Instead of using a `RendererBuilder`, construct an Instance/Adapter/Device with `rend::create_iad` and pass that to `Renderer::new`.
  - Surfaces are now controlled by the user. There is a convinence function `rend3::configure_surface` to make this smoother.
- rend3: `Texture::width` and `Texture::height` replaced with `Texture::size`
- rend3: `RendererStatistics` is now an alias for `Vec<wgpu_profiler::GpuTimerScopeResult>`
- rend3: `Texture::mip_levels` was split into `mip_count` and `mip_source` allowing you to easily auto-generate mipmaps.
- rend3: Changed limits such that intel gets CPU mode until [wgpu#1111](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/1111) gets resolved.
- rend3-pbr: creation and resizing's `resolution` argument replaced with options containing resolution and sample count.

### Updated
- Dependencies:
  - `glam` 0.17 -> 0.18

### Fixed
- rend3-pbr: Shadow artifacting due to incorrect face culling when rendering shadow passes
- rend3-pbr: CPU mode drawing failed to account for proper vertex offsets
- rend3-pbr: Non-normalized normal maps now work correctly.
- rend3-pbr: Growing the GPU mode texture descriptor list no longer causes panic
- rend3-gltf: albedo-texture UV transform is now respected
- rend3-gltf: image loading now properly caches images

### Removed
- rend3: `RendererBuilder` replaced with explicit calls to `Renderer::new`.
- rend3: `Renderer::delete_*` functions were removed in favor of refcounting.

## v0.0.6

Released 2021-08-22

### Added
- `rend3_types` crate with all datatypes.

### Changed
- `rend3::datatypes` is now renamed to `rend3::types`. It is a reexport of `rend3_types`.
- `rend3::types::TextureFormat` is a reexport of `wgpu_types::TextureFormat`.
- Replaced Renderlists with Render Routines
  - `rend3_list` crate is now `rend3_pbr`.
  - `Swapchain` mentions are now `Surface`.
  - `set_options` is now `set_internal_surface_options`
  - The following are now functions of the render routine:
    - `resize` is on both.
    - `set_background_texture` now takes an `Option<TextureHandle>` and there is no `clear_background_texture`.
- `log` is now used for logging as opposed to `tracing`, so `env_logger` should be used over `wgpu_subscriber`.

### Updated
- `wgpu` 0.7 -> 0.10
- `glam` 0.13 -> 0.17

### Removed
- `span` and `span_transfer`, due to `tracing`'s removal.
- All ties to `switchyard`.
- Shader compiling infrastructure is gone, shaders must be wgsl or pre-compiled to spirv.
