//! Easy to use, customizable, efficient 3D renderer library built on wgpu.
//!
//! Library is currently under heavy development and the api will rapidly change
//! as things are factored. While it's still in development, rend3 is able to be
//! used to build programs.
//!
//! Rend3 is not currently release on crates.io, to use it add the following
//! to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```text
//! rend3 = { version = "0.1", git = "https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3.git" }
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Take a look at the [examples] for examples on how to use the api.
//!
//! [examples]: https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3/tree/trunk/examples
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! `rend3` tries to fulfill the following usecases:
//!  1. Games and visualizations that need a customizable and efficient renderer.
//!  2. Small projects that just want to put objects on screen, but want lighting and effects.
//!  3. A small cog in a big machine: a renderer doesn't interfere with the rest of the program.
//!
//! `rend3` is not:
//!  1. A renderer for AAA games. AAA games have requirements far beyond any possible indie game and would be unreasonable to target.
//!  2. A framework or engine. It does not include all the parts needed to make an advanced game or simulation nor care how you structure
//!     your program. I do have plans for a `rend3-util` (or similar) crate that is a very basic framework for the second use case listed above.
//!
//! # Future Plans
//!
//! I have grand plans for this library. An overview can be found in the issue tracker
//! under the [enhancement] label.
