//! Easy to use, customizable, efficient 3D renderer library built on wgpu.
//!
//! Library is under active development. While internals are might change in the
//! future, the external api remains stable, with only minor changes occuring as
//! features are added.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Take a look at the [examples] for getting started with the api. The examples
//! will show how the core library and helper crates can be used.
//!
//! [examples]: https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3/tree/trunk/examples

//! # Crates
//!
//! The `rend3` ecosystem is composed of a couple core crates which provide most
//! of the functionality and exensibility to the library, extension crates, and
//! integration crates
//!
//! ### Core
//!
//! - `rend3`: The core crate. Performs all handling of world data, provides the
//!   Renderer and RenderGraph and defines vocabulary types.
//! - `rend3-routine`: Implementation of various "Render Routines" on top of the
//!   RenderGraph. Also provides for re-usable graphics work. Provides PBR
//!   rendering, Skyboxes, Shadow Rendering, and Tonemapping.
//!
//! ### Extensions
//!
//! There are extension crates that are not required, but provide pre-made bits
//! of useful code that I would recommend using.
//!
//! - `rend3-framework`: Vastly simplifies correct handling of the window and
//!   surface across platforms.
//! - `rend3-gltf`: Modular gltf file and scene loader.
//!
//! ### Integration
//!
//! Integration with other external libraries are also offered. Due to external
//! dependencies, the versions of these may increase at a much higher rate than
//! the rest of the ecosystem.
//!
//! - `rend3-anim`: Skeletal animation playback utilities. Currently tied to rend3-gltf.
//! - `rend3-egui`: Integration with the [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)
//!   immediate mode gui.
//! - `rend3-imgui`: Integration with the [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
//!   immediate mode gui.
//!
//! # Features and Platform Support
//!
//! rend3 supports two different rendering profiles one for speed and one for
//! compatibility.
//!
//! ### Profile Features
//!
//! The modern profile not only offloads a lot more work to the gpu, it can do more
//! aggressive performance optimizations including only drawing exactly the triangles that are needed
//!
//! | Profile   | Texture Access | Object Culling | Triangle Culling | Draw Calls          |
//! |:----------|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
//! | GpuDriven | Bindless       | On GPU         | On GPU           | Merged Indirect     |
//! | CpuDriven | Bound          | On CPU         | ‚ùå                | Instanced Direct    |
//!
//! ### Profile Support
//!
//! The following table shows support of various profiles on various apis/platforms. This will
//! hopefully help you judge what your target demographic supports.
//!

//! # Purpose
//!
//! `rend3` tries to fulfill the following usecases:
//!  1. Games and visualizations that need a customizable, and efficient renderer.
//!  2. Projects that just want to put objects on screen, but want lighting and effects.  
//!  3. A small cog in a big machine: a renderer that doesn't interfere with the rest of the program.
//!
//! `rend3` is not:
//!  1. A framework or engine. It does not include all the parts needed to make an
//!     advanced game or simulation nor care how you structure your program.  
//!     If you want a very basic framework to deal with windowing and event loop management,
//!     `rend3-framework` can help you. This will always be optional and is just there to help
//!     with the limited set of cases it canhelp
//!
//! # Future Plans
//!
//! I have grand plans for this library. An overview can be found in the issue
//! tracker under the [enhancement] label.

//! # Matrix Chatroom
//!
//! We have a matrix chatroom that you can come and join if you want to chat
//! about using rend3 or developing it:

//! If discord is more your style, our meta project has a channel which mirrors
//! the matrix rooms:
